## **1. Project Overview**

The project involves upgrading the Casinc payment system to enhance security using smart contracts and migrating the frontend from vanilla JavaScript to React (or Next.js). The current system has been hacked multiple times, and the goal is to implement a secure, scalable, and modern solution.

## **2. Objectives**

1. **Security Upgrade**: Implement smart contracts to secure deposits, withdrawals, and betting functionality.
2. **Frontend Modernization**: Migrate the frontend to React (or Next.js) while maintaining the existing design.
3. **Improved Architecture**: Move more functionality on-chain to enhance transparency and security.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Ensure smooth integration between the frontend, backend, and smart contracts.
5. **Testing and Deployment**: Thoroughly test the system and deploy it securely.

## **3. Scope of Work**

The project will be divided into five phases:

### **Phase 1: Project Analysis and Planning**

- Analyze the current application (frontend, backend, and payment flow).
- Reverse-engineer the design of the current application.
- Define requirements for smart contracts and frontend migration.
- Create a high-level architecture design.

### **Phase 2: Smart Contract Development**

- Develop and test the Casinc Contract (deposits, betting, withdrawals).
- Develop and test the Admin Contract (multisig approvals, game parameters).
- Deploy contracts to a testnet and conduct security audits.

### **Phase 3: Frontend Migration to React**

- Set up a React (or Next.js) project.
- Reverse-engineer and implement the current design in React.
- Develop reusable components and integrate with the backend and smart contracts.

### **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**

- Integrate the frontend, backend, and smart contracts.
- Conduct end-to-end testing, security testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
- Fix bugs and optimize performance.

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**

- Deploy the application to the mainnet and production servers.
- Provide documentation and post-deployment support.

- **AWS** or **Google Cloud**:
  - **Why**: For hosting the backend and frontend.
- **GitHub Actions** or **CircleCI**:
  - **Why**: For continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

### **Security Enhancements**

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - **Why**: To add an extra layer of security for admin accounts.
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - **Why**: To prevent DDoS attacks and abuse of the API.
- **SSL/TLS**:
  - **Why**: To encrypt data in transit between the client and server.

## **8. Risk Management**

| **Risk**                              | **Impact** | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Delays in reverse-engineering design  | Medium     | Allocate additional time for design analysis and involve the client in the review process. |
| Security vulnerabilities in contracts | High       | Conduct thorough security audits and testing before deployment.                            |
| Integration issues                    | Medium     | Use modular development and continuous integration (CI) practices.                         |
| Scope creep                           | High       | Clearly define the scope and obtain client sign-off before starting each phase.            |

## **9. Communication Plan**

- **Weekly Status Meetings**: To discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **Daily Stand-ups (for the team)**: To ensure alignment and address blockers.
- **Client Reviews**: At the end of each phase, present deliverables for feedback and approval.
- **Communication Tools**: Slack for day-to-day communication, Zoom for meetings, and email for formal updates.
